    "Given\n",
    "- Crowdsourced labels account for about half of the training dataset.\n",
    "- The crowdsourced labels are fairly accurate\n",
    "- They do not cover the entire training dataset\n",
    "- They are not available for the test set or during inference\n",
    "\n",
    "To make up for their lack of training set coverage, we combine crowdsourced labels with heuristic labeling functions to increase the number of training labels. We will use the denoised labels to train a deep learning model which can be applied to new, unseen data to automatically make predictions."

    "## Dataset Details\n",
    "This tuturial will use [Weather Sentiment](https://data.world/crowdflower/weather-sentiment) dataset from Figure Eight. The goal is to train a classifier that can label new tweets as expressing either a positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crowdworkers were asked to label the sentiment of a particular tweet relating to the weather. The catch is that 20 crowdworkers graded each tweet, and in many cases crowdworkers assigned conflicting sentiment labels to the same tweet. This is a common issue when dealing with crowdsourced labeling workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each crowdworker's labels are treated as coming from a single labeling function (LF). This will allow us to learn a weight for how much to trust the labels from each crowdworker. We will also write a few heuristic labeling functions to cover the data points without crowd labels. Snorkel's ability to build high-quality dataset from multiple noisy labeling signals make it an ideal framework to approach this problem.\n",
